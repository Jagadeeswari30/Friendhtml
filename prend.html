	<h1 style="color: blue;font-size: 40px;" class="p2">Friendship is as sweet as it is, but you should always try to make the right kind of friends who would be a strong support in helping you grow. Bad friends can make you feel good about everything you do, especially when you do something that is not right. This kind of a friendship would never help you grow to become the kind of person you are destined to be.
